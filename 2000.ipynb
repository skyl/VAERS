The diagnoses were autistic spectrum disorder and developmental delay. The autism, aphasia, cognitive disturbance, developmental delay, grand mal convulsion, and speech disorder were considered \"significant medical events\". At the time of the report, the pt had not recovered from autism and possible autistic spectrum disorder and primary language disorder. Follow-up information indicated that on the day of vaccination 05/05/1992, the pt developed a temperature and during the month of May 1992 he had a loss of awareness, was distant and \"stopped responding.\" In June 1992, the pt developed \"sticky eyes\" and conjunctivitis and in July 1992, he developed head banging and \"spots with capillary flare on his right wrist, left forearm and on the face. In October 1992, the pt had a cold which lasted for 3 weeks. In No',\n",

Sat up at 4 1/2 months, walked at 9 months and started talking at 10 or 11 months. After he received this IZ, this started to disappear. He is now autistic and I know he would not be without the MMR vaccine. The presence of mercury, aluminum and formaldyhide are in this vaccine. They are at toxic levels. Please take this off the market and make other kids safe from this happening again. Every symptom for mercury poisoning is a symptom for autism. I am utterly shocked that this relationship has been overlooked for so long. He now has food intolerances, allergies and digestive problems, visual disturbances, sensory problems and the list is endless. No formal diagnosis to be made until child's 3rd birthday, now in speech, physical and occupational therapies, went through psychological testing.\",\n",

My son received his routine vaccinations on 2/17/99 and had displayed a normal childhood development, including language skills, social skills and other pertinent childhood landmarks. A few days prior to vaccinations, he was showing some UR symptoms including sneezing and nasal discharge. About 12 days, post vax, he became lethargic and depressed. He became anorexic and also began having diarrhea. He was running a low-grade fever, so we began standard dosing of ibuprofen and Tylenol, which seemed to control the fever. However, around day 13, his symptoms became worse and the OTC meds were not controlling the fever. Unfortunately, at the time, we were en route to Florida via airline, so we did not have much choice but to wait until our arrival there to seek medical attention. On 3/4/99, at 01:00, we visited an ER where he was examined, found to have a high fever and was assumed that he had a viral infection. We were told to encourage fluid uptake and sent home. Over the next few days, his fever broke, but we noticed that he still seemed in a daze and his diarrhea persisted. As the weeks and months went by, we began to notice major changes in his behavior. He became withdrawn, preferring to play with himself rather than his siblings. He became heavily focused on certain activities and lost his language and eye contact. We began to wonder if he had lost his hearing, but tests proved negative. In the spring of 2000, a neurologist confirmed our fears that he had become autistic. Since then, we have instituted numerous behavior and biological therapies in an effort to help him. We have reviewed tape of him up to the time of his 16 month check-up and they showed a completely normal child. As a parent, we watch these videos with a broken heart, feeling that our child's mental health had been robbed from him. Since the introduction of the MMR vaccine, rates for autism in the USA have increased from 1:10,000 in early 1980's to 1:200 today. We are convinced that our son had a reaction to\"], dtype=object)"
