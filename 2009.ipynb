The doctor noted that patient had \\x93no eye contact,\\x94 was \\x93known to have autism,\\x94 and was \\x93screaming all the time.\\x94 Patient received three vaccines: for oral polio; diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis; and measles, mumps, and rubella. One month later, at the request of the school, patient received his Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine. August 25, 1991. Patient began the regular fall semester of his Early Childhood Intervention program. \\x93He reentered the Early Learning Program,\\x94 I wrote in a letter to a friend, \\x93and met all of his first year developmental goals within a month. His teachers are astounded. So are we.\\x94 September 6, 1991. Which therapy was helping patient? I said vitamins; another said light. Careful to keep our disagreement from spilling over to patient, I wrote to Dr. for advice. He suggested that we try one therapy at a time and observe the results. We took patient off B6 and DMG. \\x93By the third week in September,\\x94 I wrote in my diary, \\x93Patient was 100% un-potty trained and was using no language except 'eee-Up!' He was masturbating like mad.\\x94 All systems were failing: potty training, language, attention span. November 5, 1991. I wrote, \\x93Attempts to replicate last summer's light therapy results have not been successful \\x85We charted patient's behavior in potty training, masturbation, commands, eye contact, socialization, and use of language. After more than two weeks, there was no clear improvement in his behavior on the light therapy compared to baseline behavior in the categories we charted.\\x94 Patient had cratered. We put him back on vitamin B6 and DMG. From a twenty-first century perspective, it's tempting to conclude that patient's four-year vaccinations were at least partially responsible for his regression. But in 1991, vaccines were not suspected as a trigger for autism. Because patient's regression didn't occur immediately after the shots, we didn't suspect a link. All we knew was that we were at the bottom of the crater, and patient wasn't responding to the B6 and DMG either. We were stuck.  6/4/09 Received medical records from parent reporter for 12/18/90-8/19/1991.

        "       'A few days after the shot, he started to wake in the night crying as if in pain and he was inconsolable.  He has always been a good sleeper and had previously slept 12 hours a night without waking.  Now he wakes almost every night.  He had dropped his naps, but now needs a nap almost every day.  His cheery disposition is now grumpy.  For the first month after the shot, we kept saying that he just wasn\\'t his usual self, that he was a little bit off, the he looked and acted as if he didn\\'t feel well.   Then we started to notice that his clear words were gone and it was difficult to understand him.  He was slurring the first and last sounds of phrases together like \"Floff\" for \"Fall off\".  We also realized that he was not parroting our words like he had around his 2nd birthday.  He stopped bringing us books to read and didn\\'t want to look at books anymore when we initiated it.  During the day, he would often cry and grab at his eye, one or the other and sometimes both, and he would cry and indicate that he wanted me to look at it, kiss it, make it better.  This happened often for a while and now every so often.  He has become clumsy, falling down, knocking things off of the table, and bumping into things.  He stopped answering us when we talked to him.  He stopped listening and obeying.  He doesn\\'t seem to hear us.  From a distance, he will look at us, but one of his eyes is a little bit off.  Up close, he will not make eye contact.  He looks at us out of the side of his eyes.  He used to look at me and talk with me when I changed his diaper, dressed him, washed his hands, but no more.  When I tell him to look at me, he tries, but it is only for a few seconds and then he looks away or scrunches up his face with his eyes closed as if it is very uncomfortable to do it.  He was an easy going kid.  Nothing ruffled his feathers.  He took everything in stride.  Now he gets upset if things are not just so.  Noisy, busy places scare him.  He wants the tags cut out of his shirts.  He cries and says \"hurt\" when I cut his fingernails.  As of 8/19/09 he will not even let me cut his nails anymore.  He ran a high fever on 8/9/09 and things got worse.  We started to notice that his body would suddenly jerk and he would stumble or fall and cry.  Feeding time has become a stressful event.  He is refusing healthy food that he previously enjoyed.  Looking back at videos taken in the past two months, we noticed that he has been shaking his head and scrunching up his face for a while.  He took a 3 hour nap on 8/20/09 and woke up with a fever.  He ran the fever through the night.  On 8/21/09 he was inconsolable and could not nap because of the fever.  It dropped to 99.5 in the afternoon and he slept through the night.  He was a happy healthy child before the shot, and now he is very sick.  We took him to the doctor on 8/20/09.

        "       \"CHIEF COMPLAINT: Rash and swollen hands and feet.  HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: This is a 19-month-old male who was well until about a week ago. States that he awoke in the middle of the night about 7 days ago and had emesis. She feels that he likely threw up more than a couple of times during his sleep because there was a large volume of vomitus in his bed. He seemed to be fine then for the next couple of days, then proceeded to have 3-4 loose stools every day since. Mom has noticed no blood in the emesis or the stools. There has been no mucous in the stools. It is just been watery and brown. There has been no fever. She became more concerned when she noticed a rash. It started with a few spots in his inner left thigh 2 days. In the last 24 hours it has progressed to cover his extremities, trunk and face. She noticed some slight edema of the hands and feet and thought his face was a little swollen too so she took him into the Emergency Center last evening on 11/25.  At that point, some blood work was obtained and a white blood cell count was noted to be 10.1 with a hemoglobin of 12.1, hematocrit of 36 and platelet count of 390,000. They performed a rapid strep test which was negative. A sed rate was noted to be 3. Electrolytes revealed a sodium of 142, potassium 5.3, chloride 106 and a bicarb of 27. Glucose was 80, BUN was 19, calcium 9.1. Creatinine was 0.3. Alkaline phosphatase was 205, AST was 33, ALT was 38. Total bilirubin was 0.1, total protein was 6.3 and albumin was 3.5. Dr. called me last evening to discuss the case and it sounded to me that the patient was stable, comfortable, and labs looked reasonable. I advised him to have the parents contact their primary care physician or return to the emergency department if there were further problems. Mom denies any recent use of antibiotics or over-the-counter medications for this patient. The following morning mom felt that the baby had not slept well and seemed to be more fussy. She thought that there was more edema of the hands and feet, although the patient was ambulating. They brought him back into the Emergency Center at which point Dr. was still on staff and elected to transfer the patient down here for us to assess his status in more detail.  REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  GENERAL: Mom states that he has had reasonable energy level.  HEENT: There has been no discharge from the eyes. No ear pain. Some slight runny nose.  CHEST: Mom says that he has had a slight cough in the past couple of days. There has been no wheezing noted.  CV/HEART: There has been no color changes and no chest pain per say.  ABDOMEN: She feels that his belly has been a little distended in the past 24-48 hours but he continues to have a normal appetite.  GU: She denies any dysuria, urgency or frequency with urination.  MUSCULOSKELETAL/NEUROLOGIC: See HPI above. It appears that he is not in any pain as he is able to ambulate.  SKIN: See above for rash.  PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: He was admitted last January 2009 for what mom describes as flu symptoms; vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration for which he was in the hospital 2-3 days. This was at another facility.  BIRTH HISTORY: He was born near term. Uncomplicated pregnancy. Birth weight was just over 7 pounds.  PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: None.  IMMUNIZATIONS: Are up to date including recent vaccination on 11/18. At that time he did receive his MMR and varicella vaccination.  DEVELOPMENT: Language Development: He has a few words, 6-7 words, per mom. He is walking normally and is starting to run and climb onto furniture. He is interactive with other persons, making good eye contact.  MEDICATIONS: None.  FAMILY HISTORY: Negative for any rheumatologic disease, kidney disease, or vasculitides. SOCIAL HISTORY: Is significant for patient living with his mother as well as mom's female roommate and her young son who is presently ill with vomiting and diarrhea.  PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  GENERAL: When I arrived to the room the pati\",\n",

Information has been received from a consumer concerning her approximately 12 month old son with no known allergies or pertinent medical history who, 6 1/2 years ago, in approximately March 2000, was vaccinated with a 0.5ml first dose of MMR II. There was no concomitant medication. Subsequently, \"around the same time\" the vaccine was given, the patient started \"showing signs\" of autism. No tests were done, the patient was not hospitalized. At the time of the report the patient had not recovered. No further information was available. There was no product quality complaint involved. Additional information from the physician indicated that she is not able to provide further information because she does not feel that patient suffered an adverse reaction to any of the medications or vaccines given to the patient at that office. Follow up information has been received from a consumer concerning her around 15 month old son who in approximately June 2000 received a dose of MMR II (lot# not reported). Then around October 2000, the patient started to developed signs of autism like blank stares and repetitive movement. The consumer reported that the patient was diagnosed with autism and had received the booster dose of MMR II. The consumer reported that she was not sure if MMRII caused the autism. The patient\\'s brother (WAES#0609USA02487) also had an adverse experience after vaccination with MMR II. Upon internal review, autism was considered to be an other important medical event.

In approximately 2004 the patient developed delayed speech. The author commented as follows: \"we do not look forward as if on the date the patient\\'s documented speech delay to decide whether his condition necessarily would result in autism. We know that delayed speech does not invariably presage and autistic disorder, but that is not the proper focus inquiry. Instead, we look back from the date the petition was filed to determine, as a historical matter, when the symptoms of the autism that we know will eventually be diagnosed were established in the record. The statute of limitations begins to run from the date that the symptoms of autism appeared that would generally be recognized in the medical community\".
